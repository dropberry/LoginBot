# LoginBot
A python bot for testing a login page for Sql injection or cracking the credentials with a provided wordlist. 
It's not a finished program where you can specify your target url etc. with flags. You have to change the parameters of the source code yourself for your own use.
Where you have to change the paths and parameters is explained in the source code.
You get the values for the HTML elements via the inspect function of your browser.

There exists easier to use programs but it was nice to program a bot perfect for my needs.

Hope I help someone out there!
